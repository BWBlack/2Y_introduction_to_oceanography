# ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ

#### Step 1 - setup the Python environment we need

- So today we will be using Python, which is just a programming language. However, you won't 
be required to do too much code editing - I would prefer that you focus on the science. But first, the computational environment we're using needs setting up.

- Download this code repo by going back to the main page and clicking the big, green button that says: `<> Code`. You can then download the repo as a zip file

- Put this file **SOMEWHERE SENSIBLE**, I strongly suggest in your [] and unzip it. This will be the directory where you do everything

- Now we start up anaconda: go to the start menu and in search, type anaconda. Somthing called anaconda prompt will appear, that's what you want.

- Now navigate to where you have saved the practical. Ask one of us if you're not sure how to do this.

- Once you have done this, open an anaconda terminal and type this:

```
conda env create -f heat_transport_prac_env.yml
```

- You will see a lot of text fly up the terminal, but that means things are working. When it's finished, run

```
conda activate heat_transport_prac_env
```

- Followed by this command, to open a Jupyter notebook session

```
jupyter notebook
```

#### Step 2 - Download the practical data in to the right directory

- The data is in this dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yh4lt269sggk8thy6pdqp/h?dl=0&rlkey=a0znm3d01v0m5t8z6b4o2le4x

- If you're downloading them one-by-one, put them in a directory (folder) named 'ECCO_data', make one if it doesn't exist

#### Step 3 - Chill
