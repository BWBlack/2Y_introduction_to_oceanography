# ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒŠ

#### Step 1 - setup the Python environment we need

- So today we will be using Python, which is just a programming language. However, you won't 
be required to do too much code editing - I would prefer that you focus on the science. But first, the computational environment we're using, miniconda, needs setting up.

- Download this code repo by clicking this button the big, green button that says: `<> Code`. You can then download the repo as a zip file

- Put this file SOMEWHERE SENSIBLE, and unzip it. This will be the directory where you do everything

- Once you have done this, open an anaconda terminal and type this:

```
conda env create -f puppies.yml
```

#### Step 2 - Download the practical data in to the right directory

- The data is in this dropbox:[link going somewhere]. Its quite a large file...
- Download this file as you normally would, and put it in the directory (folder) named
'ECCO_data'
